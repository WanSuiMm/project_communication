# Context for incremental scientific review

## Formal status

- Scientific status: `INCONCLUSIVE_POSITIVE_CONTROL` in both 2D and 3D.
- Endpoint reached: completed Gate A, 20 model/seed/dimension runs.
- RT fit status: not qualified even at training-shape distance 16.
- Software status: numerical and end-to-end smoke checks passed.
- Not run: Gate B, Gate C, r=4/8/16/32/64 width scan, real vision, foundation
  pretraining, directed transport, DEQ, generation or video.
- Independent replicate: training seed (1729, 2718). Test examples, voxels and
  timing repetitions do not create additional training replicates.

## Hypothesis and variants

Main hypothesis: retain local H, emit Q with r<C channels, exchange Q through a
content-dependent symmetric nearest-neighbor medium, then update H locally.
Width C=64, r=32, four groups and eight updates form a reduced-width screen of
the earlier illustrative C=128 design. Residual scale starts at 0.1.

Controls: CNN has eight unshared local cells; NCA has two cells repeated four
times each; attention substitutes global SDPA messages at the same r; constant
transport fixes internal conductance to one. Learned transport predicts local
conductance from E and normalized H at each phase start. All get the same
normalized coordinate inputs and target-only readout. Parameter counts differ.

Gate A has one random source bit. Gate B would add four sources on separated
straight regions and an oracle-edge diagnostic. Gate C would compare equal-
width Q=H arms differing only in residual base H versus T(H), using joint remote
source/local-detail labels. These B/C implementations are smoke-tested, not
scientifically evaluated.

## Evidence route and boundaries

Read `RESULTS.md` and the small `evidence/qualification_v1_1/summary.json` first.
Use `config.json` to establish the protocol; use `aggregate.json` only for
per-axis evaluations, losses, gradients, memory and individual timing records.
`PUBLICATION_MANIFEST.json` binds evidence to hashes of the code actually run.

Do not interpret chance-level RT scores as distance extrapolation failure after
successful fitting: it did not fit the training evaluation. Attention's one
successful seed demonstrates task solvability, but its failed second seed
violates the frozen positive-control requirement. Neither successful solver
checks nor a formal global receptive field establish useful learned routing.

Timing scope: batch one, fixed large thin grids, float32 portable PyTorch
implementation, synchronized wall time including Python, two seeds. The
128-update NCA timing is a path-length cost reference; accuracy at 128 recurrent
updates was not qualified. The evidence does not establish the speed ceiling
of a fused transport kernel or a tuned attention backbone.

## Useful reviewer questions

1. Which missing training qualification would most cheaply distinguish sparse
   message dilution from generic optimization failure?
2. Is any claimed communication advantage confounded by target markers,
   coordinates, local evidence paths or differing parameter counts?
3. After a reliable fitting control, what intervention would isolate medium
   learning from message emission and reception?

No additional experiment has been run to answer these questions.
